"Do I have time to run to les toilettes before we start?"
We have returned to the small Franco-American branch where we have our two-week language intensive course. We just came from lunch at the Resto U (Restaurant Universitaire) where between the hours of 12:30 and 1:30 hundreds of French students cram into a cafeteria the size of my backyard. They (and we) line up along one wall in a queue that plods out through the doors. It's a perfect fifteen minutes for people-watching, poster-reading (Love-Boat was that famous in France?), and speculating what's on the plates (is it yogurt? is it custard? do you eat it with a knife?) No matter, it's generally delicious.
The line creeps up to stacks of grey trays, buckets of silverware and baguettes, then little bowls of grated carrots or cheese with a tomato. Finally you get a plate loaded with soft green beans, steak so raw you can't cut it with a knife, and a pile of toasty fries. Standard cafeteria food. (My host-mom, on the other hand, makes amazing meals at the drop of a hat. Every night I think it can't get better: squash soap, followed by a thin pizza with crinkly cucumbers, tomatoes, and oh! the cheese...!)  After dropping the cafeteria lady a purple pre-paid lunch ticket, we join the crowd of circling vultures. We see a table of students finishing chocolate mousse and make a bee-line for it, slipping into seats one by one as the others layer on coats and scarves and depart.  We scarf our food (who says the French eat slowly?). The entire time we eat, with the backs of our chairs pressed up against the chairs of the girls behind us, the queue never shortens. We haven't moved. So where on Earth do they all go? I assume the rest are forced to get sandwiches- the baguette and saucisson kind - and then stand outside on the steps in the 35 degree weather.  We hurry through the complicated process of emptying and returning dishes and tumble out into the streets.
 

Only two squares and three side-streets away, we find a part of Rennes that is another France entirely. While the downtown looks like any other city, except more sleek, chic, and with cobblestone streets, this side of Rennes has been here since the Middle Ages.  Houses perch over buildings of stone. The visible cross-beams are wood in cream stone, and the wooden doors are painted dark red, blue, or aquamarine.
To get to the Institute, which is crammed in a corner and at the end of an alleyway, we pass by a square with a chatelet (little castle) and tower on one side, and the sliding glass doors of an Orange (mobile phone store) set in the medieval stone on the other. We continue up a narrow street where the second stories of the wooden houses advance over the street. Square black lanterns dangle overhead. It's impossible to mistake the street because at the far end rises the bell-shaped spire of a church. We take the alleyway, marked by a modest placard and the boutique sign "Funky Monkey." We walk past the painted doors, the enclosed courtyards, and under the second story of a stone building that decided to grow across the top of the alley walls, and reach the Institute. It's surprisingly grand for a building that no one sees, in a courtyard no one expects to find. But I have realized that here one cannot calculate the area of a space from the street. The streets weren't laid in a grid. They grew. They grew the way water runs down a window, a trail that balls up and branches off at an invisible obstacle.  You can take a side street that appears to head parallel, and with barely a twist or a turn find yourself on the steps of a cathedral at the opposite end of where you wanted to go. From the street it looks charming. From above it looks like a tangled ball of yarn.  We have arrived.
"So? Do I have five minutes?"
The answer is: Yes, you have the infamous French Five; anywhere from two minutes to fifteen. I risk it. I take the stairs, remember to pull, not push the door, enter the un-gender-specified toilet, and lock the door. From head to toe it's sea-foam green. The toilet has no seat, you have to tug an unfinished plastic handle to flush, and there's no toilet paper left. The ten-inch sink runs barely a trickle of water and there's a mango sitting on the radiator that's been there every day of the two weeks. But outside the arched window, through the iron bars of a spiral staircase, I see the molded outline of a stone building and a vast, pearly-grey sky. Is France different? Yes. But right here, standing with my wet hands in the sink, I can't think of anything more beautiful.

            You know the “deer in the headlights” look? That look a deer gets just before getting completely totaled by a car? I have mastered it while being a study abroad student in France. Restaurants, the metro, at school, it has happened everywhere.
In the United States, I would say that one of my most profound qualities is confidence. I always thought of myself as a pretty confident person as I am independent and hard working. However, here in France I have noticed that I rarely feel the same day-to-day confidence I felt back in the States. Frankly, the constant fear of not understanding and in most cases not fully comprehending a simple conversation is foreign to me. To hear and understand makes one comfortable. Thus, when it takes me three tries to order a carafe d’eau with the correct pronunciation, and for the waiter to understand me and come back with an actual bottle of water, I feel shy and embarrassed for not being able to simply ask for water. It is an interchange I take for granted in the United States.
Situations like those have continually shattered my confidence. But, I suppose it is to be expected. I see the waiter coming, and I know I have to ask for the carafe. I worry to myself, “Will he understand me?” And voilà! A frequently awkward interchange is communicated and while it is not a huge problem, it is an uncomfortable moment. I have grown accustomed to times like these. Sure, they were more frequent upon first arriving in France. But still, every time I have a direct conversation with someone in French, I automatically lower my voice, my heart beats faster, and I get very nervous. Perhaps in my brain, I have been told ‘wrong’ so many times this semester that I just brace myself for the miscommunication that is almost inevitably going to occur.
In fact, I do not think I have ever been corrected more frequently than these four months in France. Every day I am corrected, usually out loud, and usually in front of other people. But of course, these corrections help, and they have gotten me to the French ‘niveau’ that I will leave with in three short weeks. I still have the “deer in the headlights” look when I am put on the spot in front of my host family to talk about my day. I am putting my linguistic skills out in the open to be judged and criticized. Honestly, how can that build your confidence or make you feel good? It won’t is the simple answer. What it will do though is force you out of the comfort bubble of the United States. I know deep down I will benefit 100 times more from being corrected by my host family here in France, than I will from not being forced to speak in French in my University classes, a.k.a. the deer not crossing the road (the easy way).
So I have taken the hard road. I get routinely embarrassed and was not prepared for being in a country that does not necessarily caudle its students and focus on what the student does well. It is rough sometimes, but the deer sometimes make it across the road, right?

    Today, we hit the five-weeks to go mark. Five weeks left in Rennes is hard to believe. We have all come so far from the first awkward meetings in the ‘jardin’ of the Paris hostel. But, today also begins our first full week back from our Fall Break. Our Fall Break consisted of a full week off of school, and if you add in the two weekends, it equates about 10 days for traveling the world.
With a group of CIEE friends, I traveled first to Porto,  Portugal.  After my first flight on RyanAir, the infamous European cheap airline, departed from Paris-Beauvais, I was impatient to start my vacation. Did you know Paris-Beauvais is not in Paris but rather a 30-euro taxi ride out side the city? After spending the night in a hostel in the center of town, we spent the following day discovering Porto on foot. We tasted Porto wine, rode a Gondola around the city, and ate a delicious Portuguese lunch along the Douro  River in the afternoon sun.
  
But we did not sit still long. That night, we packed our bags and took another flight, this time flying to another continent. We landed that night in Marrakech, Morocco: aka Africa. It was the first time for all of us to set foot on African soil, but once we landed, we wasted no time.

We quickly darted to our hotel, or to be more specific, former Sultan’s palace. We all felt like royalty from the minute we stepped into the hotel; the swimming pool, marble ceilings, and traditional Morocco dinner only added to our enchantment. The next three days we spent exploring the ‘Medina,’ the old city of Marrakech, riding camels, haggling in the ‘Souk,’ and taking a guided tour up into the Atlas Mountains to see some beautiful landscapes as well as some Morocoo villages.

I bought many treasures (Christmas presents) for my friends from the markets, and even saved the last of my ‘durams’ to remember my first African adventure.
  
After Morocco, everyone went his or her separate ways; some met up with other friends in other countries and some returned to Rennes to spend time with their host families. I traveled back to France with another student, however we decided to stay in the warm weather and landed in Nice on the Cote d’Azur. I spent the final four days of my vacation reading books on the rock beaches and swimming in the Mediterranean. I also was lucky to see a very different part of France, one with a very Italian influence in contrast to the Breton culture in Rennes.
  
But as all vacations do, mine came to an end, and I returned close to midnight on Halloween to my home in Rennes. My host dad was nice enough to pick me up at the train station, and I was so happy to return home to my own bed. In my bed was my first, and best friend in France, my ‘host cat’ Aby. I promised myself I would unpack in the morning, and quickly fell asleep alongside ‘mon chat.’
What I will remember most from my vacation was not the quirky hostel in Porto, swimming in our hotel pool in Marrakech, or getting a suntan in Nice. What I will remember is how much I used my French while traveling. I realized on this trip the true value of being able to not only use, but to effectively learn another language. In both Morocco and Nice I spoke French the majority of the time. It was very cool to see that my French was functional outside of our University classes, where the professors are very accustomed to understanding our broken French.  Seeing this on my vacation only makes me more excited and lucky to have this opportunity to study French in Rennes.
So with these short five weeks I have left, I have even more motivation to improve. I will make the most out of these five weeks, as I now better understand the importance and privilege of learning a second language.

I spent last weekend in Normandy with my study abroad group. We left early Saturday morning and took a bus to Caen. There is a WWII memorial museum there, and it was amazing.

There was so much information and photos, we even got to see a video. It was very inspiring. The French are really thankful to the Americans actually, I have heard some of the other people in the study abroad group say that older people have thanked them for the help of the Americans during the war.  Afterwards, we went to the Bayeux Tapestry which depicts the conquest of William the Conqueror. It was so amazing and I am so glad we had the opportunity to see it! Unfortunately, we had to listen to the recording of the story in French, so I kind of missed parts of what happened. It is so long and detailed though; truly awesome. I can't imagine how long it took the creators to make it. We walked about the town a little bit, and I found a cool double oven mitt with a modern rendition of the tapestry on it! I can’t wait to put it in my kitchen one day.
We got settled into our hostel, and shortly afterwards had dinner at a superb restaurant. We had a seafood salad, with shrimp, salmon, and pate, then chicken in curry with a lasagna potatoe side! Afterwards, an apple tart type of dessert. We also had some red wine with dinner :) Excellent!
 The next day we went to the American cemetery on Omaha Beach. It was quite sobering. It is astounding to see how many people died there. I am so glad we were able to look at it. I feel like it is an important thing for people to see. The monuments are beautiful.
Afterwards, we went to Pointe du Hoc, which is another beach which was a major fighting point in WWII. At this area, there are only bomb craters as far as the eye can see. Every 10 feet there is a 20 ft wide hole. The land is also speckled with bunkers and other hide-outs. Most of them are blown up, and only hunks of concrete remain, but a few are intact and you can walk around them, and inside of them. It is eerie and strange. It is hard to imagine when one is walking around on a peaceful, lovely day that at one point in time the area was no man’s land and a war zone.  We came back to Rennes after that; it took about two hours to get home, but it was nice to sleep and read on the bus. I am really looking forward to our next excursion: Cornouaille!

      	<div style="clear: both;"></div>
      	<div class="reading">
For our latest (and unfortunately our last) excursion of the semester, we spent a warm and magical weekend visiting the castles of the Loire Valley.  The weekend was magical for so many reasons:  the absolute beauty and historical intrigue of each and every castle, the refinement in the landscape design of the many gardens, the allure and elegance of the entire Loire Valley region and of the Loire River itself (the longest in France), the good fortune to enjoy unseasonably warm and cloudless weather in mid-April, and of course more than anything else, the good feelings, good food and wine, games of frisbee, laughter, and friendship shared by all for two glorious sun-filled days.
Our weekend began on Saturday morning with a visit to the chateau de Brissac.  With seven stories in all, Brissac is the tallest castle in France.  It was originally built as a fortified castle by the Counts of Anjou in the 11th century, but was rebuilt in large part in the 15th century and was acquired in the 16th century by Réné de Cossé.  The chateau has been in the Cossé-Brissac family ever since, despite the fact that it was ransacked during the French Revolution and was only returned to the Cossé-Brissac family to be restored in 1844.  The descendants still live there today.
  
The Chateau de Brissac may not be the most well-known or the most visited castle in the region, but quite a few students expressed the opinion that it was one of the castles they enjoyed the most of the four that we visited.  So, it was indeed, a great start to all of the interesting and beautiful places to come.  The visit was led by a friendly and knowledgeable young French guide.  He led us to several “secret” rooms and passages, including the bedroom of Louis XIII, who reconciled with his mother, Marie de Medicis, in 1620 in this very room.

The chateau also boasts a surprising “Belle Epoque” theatre, added in 1890, and a wine cellar where we were able to do a small wine tasting with our students of several Anjou wines from the chateau’s 28-hectare vineyard.  No wonder, then, that this visit was so popular!
  
We then walked to lunch at a nearby restaurant where we had a delicious meal of pasta with fresh vegetables and parmesan and followed by a salad of fresh fruits (yum!)
Our second visit was to the Chateau de Villandry.  This early 16th-century castle was constructed around what was originally a 14th century fortress.  The castle was confiscated from the Marquis de Castellane during the French Revolution, and in the early19th century Napoleon Bonaparte acquired it for his brother, Joseph Bonaparte. 

There is also an American connection here, because it was purchased in 1906 by the Spaniard, Joachim Carvallo and his American wife, Ann Colman, who devoted their lives to saving and refurbishing the castle which was about to be demolished, and to recreating the original Renaissance-style gardens. 

Their great-grandson, Henri, still lives in the chateau today with his wife and children.  The gardens are amongst the most beautiful in all of France.  The students had fun in the labyrinth and strolling the grounds admiring the landscaping, and soaking in the sun.
  
So, after a wonderful information and sun-filled day, we headed off for an evening in Tours, where we again had a great meal and plenty of good conversation, followed by a free evening of sightseeing and enjoying the nightlife of Tours.
In the morning it was back on the bus again and off to the Loire Valley’s most visited, and arguably its most beautiful, as well as one of its historically most interesting castles, Chenonceaux.
  
This chateau is often referred to as the “Ladies Castle”, in reference to the various women in French history who greatly influenced the construction and development of Chenonceau over the centuries. Not only is the castle magnificent, but the grounds surrounding the castle, and most particularly the landscaped gardens are breathtaking. 

We would have all liked to stay even longer at Chenonceau, and one could easily spend an entire day enjoying everything there is to discover there, but another nice lunch was awaiting us in a nearby restaurant, as were the guides at our next destination...
So, our final visit was of the Chateau d’Ambroise.  We walked up the steep ramparts leading to the entryway of the castle, where we met our guide.  On first view, the castle doesn’t appear to be as big as many of the others that we visited, but our guide informed us that a substantial part of the castle was demolished as a consequence of the French Revolution, and demolition continued up to the start of the 19th century.  The history of Ambroise is, of course, another fascinating one, including many famous figures: Catherine de Medicis and her husband, King Henri II, King François I, who invited Leonardo da Vinci to live and work nearby (DaVinci is actually buried in the small chapel on the grounds of the chateau), Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots, and her husband King François II, and the wars of religion between Catholics and Protestants. 

Our guide showed us the iron balcony and the castle walls from which, in 1560, over 1000 Protestants were hung for plotting against the king.  He explained to us that this event cast a shadow over the castle from which it never completely recovered. Our guide also taught us the origins of the game of tennis ( it descends from the French “jeu de paume”) and how King Charles VIII died one of the stupidest deaths ever recorded for a king after hitting his head on the top of one of the doorways of the chateau.
The sky was so clear and perfect, and we were so warm after our visit, that many of us stopped for ice cream and sodas as we meandered the grounds and contemplated the majesty and long history of this fabulous place once frequented by kings and queens and still owned and maintained today by the descendants of King Louis-Philippe.
  
And there it was, time to get back on the bus for the 3+ hour ride back to Rennes, after what I think most of us agreed was a nearly perfect weekend.  The weather surely helped, but I honestly think that it had to do, mainly, with the fun, interesting, and interested students who make up this semester’s group.  They are now all on spring vacation from their classes, and many of them are visiting other parts of France or of Europe.  We will be back together again in just over a week, and the CIEE program in Rennes will be celebrating it’s 40th anniversary in grand style just a few days after their return.  Yet, while we are all very excited about this event, we also know that the end of the semester is near.  Many of our students have expressed sadness that they must leave France soon, and we will also be sad to see them go.  It is easy to become attached to the individuals we meet each semester, and this group is no exception.  We have visited the Chateaux de la Loire many times now with different groups of CIEE students, but each visit stands out in our memories as being unique, and this one was as awesome as they come!

Thus far, CIEE Rennes has been incredible! The program started in Paris where all of the participants were lucky enough to enjoy tours around the center of Paris on foot and on water! We walked, we observed, and we listened, to the voice of a very intelligent and vibrant tour guide that informed us of all of the ins-and-outs of the infamous city. Flowing along the Seine River we watched as Paris lit up the sky with the numerous lights attached to the monuments located on each of the islands of Paris.

 Everything has been wonderful; the food, the people, even the weather! There is always a place for people to find pleasure in Paris that became true to my friends and I when we went out to find a restaurant after one of our tours. Walking along the narrow streets, watching people pass by, laugh, kiss… we all felt so happy and blessed to be in such a place.
 The travel to Rennes was quite the trip! We all shook with nervousness to find out whom we would be living with for the next four months. Thanks to the great organization and hard work of the directors, all of us were very happy with our assigned host families and have thus spent many exciting days exploring Rennes and all it has to offer.

        <div style="clear: both"></div>
       	<div class="reading">
    Celebrating my birthday while studying abroad in Rennes will be one of the events I remember most from my time in Bretagne. It was my 21st birthday nonetheless, and the first birthday I have spent neither seeing my family, nor speaking on the phone to all my grandparents and close friends. Thus, I was skeptical about wanting to celebrate at all, anticipating I might become even more homesick with acknowledgement the big day. Well, Thursday the 17th came and went, and I am pleased to report with the help of my new CIEE friends, and wonderful French host family, I had the best 21st birthday I could have asked for.
Thursday night, after a long day of classes, I came home to find my host mom had prepared a spaghetti dish, knowing that Italian food is my favorite. My host family and I, six people in all, sat down and laughed together as I helped my host brother with his English homework. Like me, my family is always busy and constantly running in and out of the house with a million things to do. Thus, we ate rather quickly. But as soon as we finished, Christine , my host mom, brought out a chocolate cake with the numerical ‘21’ candles to the table. They sang ‘Happy Birthday’ to me in English (it was funny considering the French cannot pronounce the ‘th’ sound and thus ‘Birsday’) and I made my 21st birthday wish. I was very happy, and also I felt very lucky that my host family took the time to go out of their way for my birthday, on the always-chaotic Thursday night. The festivities did not end there, however.

Christine was nice enough to offer to either take the family to a restaurant for my birthday, or cook a ‘repas’ for our family and a few friends. Christine  happens to be a fabulous cook, so I did not hesitate to take her up on her offer to have a Sunday lunch at my house, and invited four of my friends to join us. I also was lucky enough to receive a small baking lesson from my host mom, and made Tiramasu and Cheesecake with her in anticipation of the gathering.
Sunday afternoon our table of ten all shared aperitifs, raclette (a traditional French meal where you melt cheese onto meat and potatoes), and the two delicious desserts we made together.

I blew out my candles again as everyone sang ‘Happy Birthday’ once more. Then my family handed me a ‘cadeau,’ my birthday gift. I opened my present to find a personalized France soccer jersey!  The name on the jersey read "Emily P." (my homestay's name starts with a P)  and the number is 21. It was perfect. I was touched that my family truly searched for an original gift, one unique to me and my semester with them.

After we could eat no more, the rest of the afternoon was dedicated to playing card games and watching a movie together. It was the perfect Sunday afternoon as I spent it with my family and friends.
So, as I said before, my birthday came and went. Do I feel older? Maybe. Do I feel wiser? Yes. After having my doubts about acknowledging anything all together, I was pleasantly surprised. My friends and family here (whom I have known no more than three months) made it one of the most memorable times of the semester, and made me feel extremely lucky to have met such kind and giving people while abroad. Perhaps that is part of the beauty of studying abroad. Good people are everywhere in the world. I am fortunate enough to have met many good people here in Rennes. Thanks to all of them, I will remember this birthday forever.

This past weekend me and my study abroad group went on an excursion to the South of Bretagne, to a region called “Cornouaille”. It was kind of cloudy and dreary, but a really fun trip overall.  We left at about 8h30 on Saturday morning, and took a long bus ride to Quimper, a very old town about 3 hours from Rennes. It was quite lovely and was surrounded by two big rivers. The city was a capital in the area for a while because it was a bigger city compared to others. It has an old government building, and an enormous church. The cathedral has actually been renovated to its original form, so it was really beautiful and I think we are lucky to get to see it like that. When we went to Chartres Cathedral, it was in the middle of being renovated and updated, so some of the parts were covered with scaffolding, so we couldn't actually "see" all of it. We had a guided tour of Quimper, and it was really interesting. The town centre had a lot of little cute stores! Me and my friends got some sweets for the trip at a little bakery.  Afterwards, we went to our hostel, which was right next to the ocean! We were so lucky. Our room seriously overlooked the cliffs and we could hear the sound of the waves crashing onto the rocks as we went to sleep. We ate dinner at the hostel too, which was surprisingly alright.
The next day we woke up at about 7h30, ate some baguettes with butter, and then were off again. We went to Pointe du Raz, which is the furthest Western point of France. It kind of looks like the middle of nowhere, and when you look into the ocean, it just goes for miles and miles.

It was really windy and wet though. And also, unfortunately, my camera died, so I did not get many pictures of it. Though I am sure it is quite beautiful when the weather permits. Me and my friend Emma made a little rock pile, which is supposed to bring you good luck? I hope so!  Afterwards, we went to a cute little medieval town, Locronan, we had an excellent lunch there. The restaurant was so fancy! We had a rose wine, with the best pumpkin soup, followed by fish with green beans and potatoes, and then a Breton specialty dessert, Kouign Amann, which is basically just layers of dough and layers of butter. Not joking. I had a piece probably 3×2, and it at least had two full sticks of butter, if not more. The town also had a very old, medieval church! It was really interesting seeing a small village church compared to the really large ones we’ve seen. I almost find the smaller ones more impressive in a way; just in that there is seriously nothing for hundreds of miles around this church, and to think that it has existed for so long and it is so well preserved, without any renovations, it is just crazy.  The rest of the trip was just a long ride home. We watched Ice Age 3 in French, which was interesting. I mostly just read a book and wrote some postcards. It was about a 4 hour ride back to Rennes, but it was really nice to relax.  Next weekend I am going back to the South of Bretagne, but this time to a region called “La Baule”. I am going with my host family, and we are leaving Saturday after my host mom is finished with work. I think it will be a good time; the kids already have some games planned for us!

        <div class="entry_title">CIEE celebrates 40 years in Rennes</div>
        <div style="clear: both"></div>
       	<div class="reading">
 
For the past year we have been doing our best to try to highlight, via this blog, our CIEE – Rennes program’s special events.  So we certainly didn’t want to miss this opportunity to report on one of our most important events by far this year – the 40-year anniversary celebration of our Rennes program which took place on May 12th, 2011
Founded in 1971, the CIEE – Rennes program was one of the first CIEE programs in the world, and the first one in France, and as such, it holds a prominent place in the history of our company.  Over the past four decades we have enjoyed an excellent relationship with the Université de Rennes II , the Centre International Rennais d’Etudes du Français pour Etrangers (CIREFE), and the City of Rennes.  Since its creation, more than 2600 students from about 150 different American universities have experienced what the university, the city and its people have to offer. 
We celebrated this momentous event with a cocktail party at the beautiful and historic hotel-restaurant, Lecoq Gadby, a Rennes institution renowned for its refined food and service, as well as its beautiful reception rooms and gardens.  It was a wonderful opportunity, and the perfect setting for us to invite and share memories with all of the people that have contributed to the success of our program for so many years thanks to their precious participation.  More than 200 guests attended the event, including our Spring 2011 students, as well as a few former students, both current and many former host families, our French moniteurs, our CIREFE colleagues, officials from the university, the city of Rennes, and the US Consulate, our CIEE Program Director for Western Europe, Catharine Scruggs, former Resident Directors, Tom Buckley and Loren Ringer, our friends from the Franco-American Institute in Rennes, and many principals and teachers from local schools in Rennes where each semester some of our students do English-language teaching internships. 
  
During the opening presentation, the various speeches from former and current participants and partners of our program complemented each other well and allowed everyone to better understand what constitutes the raison d’être of our program and our mission at CIEE.  As illustrated in each and every speech, our program would and could not be what it is today without our students, their universities, our host families, the Université de Rennes II, the City of Rennes, and absolutely all of our friends and partners. 
This very special anniversary party also marked the end of the semester for our Spring 2011 students.  There was much laughter and happiness as students recalled their semester here in Rennes during the photomontage prepared by one of our students, and a few tears were shed as well while host families and their host sons and daughters were reminded of the fact that they would be parting in less than one week. 
We would like to take this opportunity to once again let our students know how much they will be (and are already!) missed.  Two of this semester’s students, Erin and Alex, gave speeches during the anniversary soirée, and both of them touched every one of us to the core.  You, our students, are the reason that we are here, and with your parting smiles, warm thank you’s, and even a few teary-eyed farewells, you have reminded us once again of how lucky we feel to be a part of your study abroad experience: living, learning, and sharing at least a small piece of this intercultural adventure along with you.  
And while it is now time to say goodbye, we must admit that we have always much preferred the French expression, “Au revoir”, which translates to something more like, “Until we meet again”...   So, we must say “Au revoir” for now, in the hopes that our paths will indeed cross again one day - and we thank you all once more for making this semester, and our program, so great! 
Here’s to the next 40 years!

During our spring semester in Rennes, we have two different vacations. For our first one, a week long winter break, my friends and I decided to use that time to travel around Ireland and Scotland. It was an amazing experience and both countries are absolutely gorgeous! Something that I found the most surprising though was not while I was traveling, but actually on the train back to Rennes from Paris. I had discovered that a sense of homesickness started to develop for me over the week. However, it was not for my home back in LaGrange, IL, but for Rennes and the French language in general.
While it was lovely getting to speak English during our vacation, I was excited to go back to hearing the familiar sound of French while riding on the 9 bus back to Cleunay or on the metro to Villejean Université. Most specifically though, I was really missing my host family! I’d been keeping in touch with my real family back in the states, but I hadn’t talked to my host family in a week.
I live with a single mother and her 8 year old daughter and upon my return, I was so happy to receive bisous and hugs from them. I really felt like I was coming back to a real family! I was excited to share the photos I had taken, talk about my adventures and recount little things from each city with them. I was also eager to hear about their vacation, they had gone skiing in the Alps for the week! My little host sister was just as excited as I was to show off the medal she had earned from her ski class.
Don’t get me wrong, things were not immediately this way when I first arrived. At first, things can feel a little different—almost awkward living in someone else’s home and having them feed you dinner every night, but it quickly changes. And for me, after one short month, I spent a week without them and I was already missing them like crazy! I missed the little games we play during meals, the familiar phrases I hear every night, and the welcoming feeling of a family.
That moment was when it hit me that I have really settled in here! I have formed a little routine and I am already seeing Rennes as a new home! It’s been a little more than 2 months that I’ve been in France now and I am finding my French to be more accessible now than ever before. I’ve also built great relationships with lots of people on our CIEE program as well as the French monitors. This program has been so much more than I even expected.
